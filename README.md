# CHIP-8 SFML
This is an interpreter for the CHIP-8 virtual machine, written in C++ and using the 
SFML multimedia library for sound and graphic representation. The instructions
are executed using different function pointer arrays, as opposed to using a simple
switch statement.

# How to run
1. Make sure that you have SFML installed and the GNU compiler collection up and ready.
2. Run 'make' in the root of the project.
3. Execute the program with a path to a binary file containing the program you wish
to run.
